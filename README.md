# accidents_2017-Dataset-
This repository demonstrates a Logistic Regression model to predict accident-related outcomes using the accidents_2017.csv dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Project Overview   :
This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques, particularly logistic regression, to predict accident-related outcomes. The dataset includes various features such as district names, weekdays, months, hours, and victims. The following tasks are performed:

Data Preprocessing: Preparing and transforming the data to make it suitable for model training. This includes handling categorical variables using techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding.

Modeling: A logistic regression model is trained to classify and predict accident outcomes. Additionally, decision tree and random forest models are applied for regression tasks where the target variable is continuous.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports for classification tasks. For regression, metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used.

Data Visualization: The project also includes visual exploration of the dataset, including accident distributions by hour, district, and day of the week. A correlation matrix is generated to analyze relationships between numeric variables.

Key Libraries
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluating them.
matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
Dataset
The dataset includes information on accidents, with features such as:

District Name: The district where the accident occurred.
Weekday: The day of the week.
Month: The month of the year.
Hour: The time of the day.
Victims: The number of victims in the accident.
Visualizations
Several plots are generated to better understand the data:

Distribution of Accidents by Hour: Shows when most accidents occur during the day.
Accidents by District: Displays accident frequency in different districts.
Accidents by Day of the Week: Highlights the distribution of accidents across the week.
Correlation Matrix: Helps understand the relationships between numeric features in the dataset.
Model Performance
The logistic regression model is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix to assess its effectiveness in predicting accident outcomes. Decision tree and random forest models are used for regression tasks and evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive overview of how to apply logistic regression and other regression techniques to real-world data, offering insights into accident patterns based on various factors.
